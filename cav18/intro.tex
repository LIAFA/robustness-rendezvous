\section{Introduction}

Communication with asynchronous message passing is widely used in concurrent and distributed programs implementing various types of systems such as cache coherence protocols, communication protocols, protocols for distributed agreement, device drivers, etc. 
%
An asynchronous message passing program is built as a collection of processes running in parallel, communicating asynchronously by sending messages to each other via channels or message buffers. Messages sent to a given process are stored in its entry buffer, waiting for the moment they will be received by the process. Sending messages is not blocking for the sender process, which means that the message buffers are supposed to be of unbounded size. 

Such programs are hard to get right. Asynchrony introduces a tremendous amount of new possible interleavings between actions of parallel processes, and makes it very hard to apprehend the effect of all of their computations. %that result from interleavings of different components. 
%Even when the message buffers are bounded, the number of reachable configurations grows exponentially with respect to both their number of processes and the size of the message buffers, and of course when buffers are unbounded, the set of possibly reachable configurations is infinite. 
Due to this complexity, verifying properties (invariants) of such systems is hard. In particular, when buffers are ordered (FIFO buffers), the verification of invariants (or dually of reachability queries) is undecidable even when each process is finite-state~\cite{DBLP:journals/jacm/BrandZ83}.

Therefore, an important issue is the design of verification approaches that avoid considering the full set of computations 
%and configurations 
to draw useful conclusions about the correctness of the considered programs. Several such approaches have been proposed including partial-order techniques, bounded analysis techniques, etc., e.g., \cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/BasuB16,DBLP:conf/oopsla/Desai0M14,DBLP:conf/tacas/BouajjaniE12,DBLP:conf/tacas/TorreMP08,DBLP:conf/popl/FlanaganG05}. Due to the hardness of the problem and its undecidability, these techniques have different limitations: either applicable only when buffers are bounded (e.g., partial-order techniques), or limited in scope, or do not provide any guarantees of termination or insight about the completeness of the analysis.
% i.e., whether the performed analysis, although restricted, captures actually all possible behaviours in the system. 

In this paper, we propose a new approach for the analysis and verification of asynchronous message-passing programs with unbounded FIFO buffers, which provides a decision procedure for checking state reachability for a wide class of programs, and which is also applicable for bounded-analysis in the general case. 

We first define a bounding concept for prioritizing the enumeration of program behaviors. %that leads to an efficient verification approach and that is applicable to message-passing programs in 
This concept is guided by our conviction that the behaviors of well designed programs can be seen as successions of {\em bounded interaction phases}, each of them being a sequence of send actions (by different processes), followed by a sequence of receive actions (again by different processes) corresponding to send actions belonging to the same interaction phase. For instance, interaction phases corresponding to {\em rendezvous communications} are formed of a single send action followed immediately by its corresponding receive. More complex interactions are the result of exchanges of messages between processes. For instance two processes can send messages to each other, and therefore their interaction starts with two send actions (in any order), followed by the two corresponding receive actions (again in any order). This exchange schema can 
%of course 
be generalized to any number of processes. 
%Other, more complex interactions are also possible, for instance by combining several exchanges. 
We say that an interaction phase is {\em $k$-bounded}, for a given $k > 0$, if its number of send actions is less than or equal to $k$. For instance rendezvous interactions are precisely 1-bounded phases.  In general, we call {\em $k$-exchange} any $k$-bounded interaction phase. 
%
Given $k > 0$, we consider that a computation is {\em $k$-synchronous} if it is a succession of $k$-exchanges.
% and we say that a computation is boundedly asynchronous if it is $k$-synchronous for some natural number $k > 0$.  
It can be seen that, in $k$-synchronous computations the sum of the sizes of all messages buffers is bounded by $k$. However, as it will be explained later, boundedness of the messages buffers does not guarantee that there is a $k$ such that all computations are $k$-synchronous. 
%Indeed, there are sequences of actions that when they appear in a computation, they forbid the rearrangement of the computation into a sequence of exchanges.  

Then, we introduce a new bounded analysis which % called {\em exchange bounding analysis} (EBA). 
for a given $k$, considers only computations that are {\em equivalent} to $k$-synchronous computations. The equivalence relation on computations is based on a notion of {\em trace} corresponding to a {\em happens-before} relation capturing the program order (the order of actions in the code of a process) and the precedence order between sends and their corresponding receives. Two computations are equivalent if they have the same trace, i.e., they differ only in the order of causally independent actions. 
%This analysis can be shown to be PSPACE-complete. 
We show that this analysis  is PSPACE-complete when processes have a finite number of states.
%This reachability analysis is called $k$-bounded exchange analysis. 
%It can be used for checking reachability properties (violations of invariants), or the existence of deadlocks. 
%

An important feature of our bounding concept is that it is possible to decide its completeness for systems composed of finite-state processes, but with unbounded message buffers: For any given $k$, it is possible to decide whether every computation of the program (under the asynchronous semantics) is equivalent to (i.e., has the same trace as) a $k$-synchronous computation of that program. 
%In other words, we define a $k$-synchronous semantics for message passing programs allowing only $k$-synchronous computations, and we show that, for any given program $P$, the equality between the set of behaviours of $P$ under the asynchronous semantics and the set of its behaviours under the $k$-synchronous semantics, is decidable. 
When this holds, we say that the program is {\em $k$-synchronizable}~\footnote{A different notion of synchronizability has been defined in~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/BasuB16} (see Section~\ref{sec:related}).}. Knowing that a program is $k$-synchronizable allows to conclude that an invariant holds for all computations of the program if no invariant violations have been found by its $k$-bounded exchange analysis. Notice that $k$-synchronizability of a program {\em does not} imply that all its behaviours use bounded buffers.
%It only means that for every computation of the program there exists another computation of the program that has the same trace and that is $k$-synchronous (and therefore, that does not need to store more than $k$ messages in the buffers). 
Consider for instance a program with two processes, a producer that consists of a loop of sends, and a consumer that consists of a loop of receives. Although there are computations where the entry buffer of the consumer is arbitrarily large, the program is 1-synchronizable because all its computations are equivalent to computations where each message sent by the producer is immediately received by the consumer. 
%(i.e., that is a succession of $k$-bounded interaction phases). 

%In the case of infinite-state processes, we show that checking $k$-synchronizability is reducible to an assertion checking problem in a system with bounded buffers, which in principle, can be discharged using the existing verification methodology.

Importantly, we show that checking $k$-synchronizability of a program, with possibly infinite-state processes, can be reduced in linear time to checking state reachability under the $k$-synchronous semantics (i.e., without considering all the program computations). Therefore, for finite-state processes, checking $k$-synchronizability is PSPACE and 
%itself be done by considering {\em only} $k$-synchronous computations (of a slightly different program), i.e., we do not need to consider all computations of the program for checking that they are all equivalent to $k$-synchronous ones. In fact, we provide a linear reduction of the problem of checking $k$-synchronizability to the state reachability under the $k$-synchronous semantics. 
%The idea is that only a class of $k$-synchronizability violations need to be considered, and these violations correspond to computations containing a cycle in a suitably defined {\em conflict graph} associated with the considered computation. In this graph, the nodes are matching pairs of send and receive actions (i.e., a send action and its corresponding receive action), and edges between such pairs correspond to program order constraints between actions of these pairs. We show that the detection of such cycles can be done by considering the $k$-synchronous semantics, using a program instrumentation that adds $k + N$ boolean variables to the program, where $N$ is the number of processes in the program. This instrumentation allows to check (basically by delaying one send action, and checking later that there is a matching receive action) that the $k+1$-synchronous semantics (when applied to the considered computation) is able to generate a cycle of size $k+1$ in the conflict graph. For instance, consider an exchange $send (p, q, m_1), send (q, p, m_2), receive (q, m_1), receive (p, m_2)$. The conflict graph has two nodes $n_1 = [ send(p, q, m_1), receive (q, m_1) ]$ and $n_2 = [ send(q, p, m_2), receive (p, m_2) ]$, and due to program constraints, there is an edge from $n_1$ to $n_2$ since $send(p, q, m_1)$ is before $receive (p, m_2)$ as well as an edge from $n_2$ to $n_1$ since $send(q, p, m_2)$ is before $receive (q, m_1)$. Therefore, this computation is not 1-synchronizable, i.e., it is not equivalent to a computation using rendezvous communications. 
%Therefore, this problem is PSPACE-complete, i.e., not harder than checking state reachability in synchronous programs. 
it is possible to decide invariant properties without dealing with unbounded message buffers when the programs are $k$-synchronizable (the overall complexity being PSPACE).

Then, a method for verifying asynchronous message passing programs can be defined, 
%Then, as usual, defining a parametrised bounded analysis concept leads to an iterative method for verifying programs 
based on iterating $k$-bounded analyses with increasing value of $k$, starting from $k=1$. If for some $k$, a violation (i.e., reachability of an error state) is detected, then the iteration stops and the conclusion is that the program is not correct. On the other hand, if for some $k$, the program is shown to be $k$-synchronizable and no violations have been found, then again the iteration terminates and the conclusion is that the program is correct. 

However, it is possible that the program is {\em not} $k$-synchronizable for any $k$. In this case, if the program is correct then the iteration above will not terminate. Thus, an important issue is to determine whether a program is {\em synchronizable}, i.e., {\em there exists a $k$ such that the program is $k$-synchronizable}. This problem is hard, and we believe that it is undecidable, but we do not have a formal proof. 
%However, we are able to define a significant class of programs, including most examples in practice, for which this problem is decidable.  
%Non-synchronizability is due precisely to two reasons: (1) mutually interacting processes have among them one process that can execute an unbounded loop of receive actions before any subsequent send action, or a receive action preceded by an unbounded loop of sends, or (2)
%%the existence of unbounded exchange phases between processes where each process has a loop of send actions to mutually interacting other processes (before any receive action). 
%the presence of exchanges which are overlapping with other interactions where sends and receives are alternating (it suffices to have one alternation). This forbids finding a rearrangement of the computation into a succession of exchanges (regardless of their boundedness). Roughly speaking, the occurrence of this âbad patternâ characterizes the fact that overlapping exchanges are not serializable. 
%
%%Then our approach is as follows: 
%First, we show that the detection of this (exchange serializability) bad pattern in $k$-synchronous computations is possible again by a linear reduction to a state reachability problem in synchronous programs. Therefore, if the pattern is found for some $k$, we know that the program is definitely not synchronizable. 
%Furthermore, we consider a syntactically defined class of programs, called {\em flow-bounded programs}, for which the first source of non-synchronizability is  discarded. 
%%A program is {\em flow-bounded} if in all of its components, there is no unbounded loop with only receive actions and no unbounded loop of only send actions from which there is a path to a receive action. 
%For this class of programs, it can be shown that a program is not synchronizable iff the serializability bad pattern mentioned before occurs in some computation of the program (under the asynchronous semantics). %Therefore, the problem of checking if there is a $k$ for which a flow-bounded program is $k$-synchronizable is decidable: Either the program is synchronizable and in this case there must be a $k$ for which it is $k$-synchronizable, or it is not synchronizable, and in this case there must be a $k$ for which the âbad patternâ is reachable by $k$-synchronous computations. 
%Notice that programs may be synchronizable without being flow-bounded. For instance, the producer-consumer program mentioned earlier is clearly not flow-bounded but it is 1-synchronous. 

%We have now all the ingredients that are used in defining our method for verifying state reachability in asynchronous message passing programs: 
%%Overall, our state reachability verification approach for asynchronous programs can be summarised as follows: 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
%If the program is flow-bounded, and if it is synchronizable (which is decidable in this case), then checking state reachability is decidable and can be done by considering only $k$-synchronous computations, for increasing values of $k$. 
%\item 
%If the program is not flow-bounded, then it is always possible to use our parametrized under-approximate analysis for arbitrarily high, fixed values of $k$. As we said earlier, the program can still be synchronizable for some $k$ (even if it is outside the syntactical class for which we have a decision procedure). So, at each step, $k$-synchronizability (which is decidable for all asynchronous programs) is checked, and if the answer is YES, then the search stops and the answer to the state reachability query is NO. If the answer to $k$-synchronizability is NO, then the procedure should be repeated for $k+1$ (or stopped by reporting absence of violations up to $k$). 
%%\begin{enumerate}
%%\item either the serializability bad pattern is not found in $k$-synchronous computation, 
%%(because of the detection of serializability bad pattern), then the procedure should be repeated for $k+1$ (or stopped by reporting absence of violations up to $k$).  
%%\end{enumerate}
%%begin{enumerate}
%%\item either the serializability bad pattern is not found in $k$-synchronous computation, 
%%(because of the detection of serializability bad pattern), then the procedure should be repeated for $k+1$ (or stopped by reporting absence of violations up to $k$).  
%%\end{enumerate}
%\item 
%If the program is flow-bounded but not synchronizable (due to detection of the serializability bad pattern), then as in the point (2) above, our parametrized under-approximate analysis for increasing values of $k$ can be applied for bug detection, but completeness can not be guaranteed. 
%\end{enumerate}

%We also show that all the techniques we develop in this paper can also be used for verifying the existence of deadlocks.

We have applied our theory to a set of nontrivial examples, two of them being presented in Section~\ref{sec:motivation}. 
All the examples are synchronizable, which confirms our conviction that non-synchronizability should correspond to an ill-designed system (and therefore it should be reported as an anomaly).

An extended version of this paper with missing proofs can be found at~\cite{arxiv}.
\vspace{-2mm}
 %Therefore, our approach always terminates and is complete for these systems.

%In fact, programs that are non flow-bounded are rare in practice, and typically this is because they contain the "producer-consumer" pattern (like the Elevator example shown in the next section). For such non flow-bounded programs, not synchronizability can only be due to the existence of the bad pattern forbidding exchange serializability. This bad pattern is eventually found for some $k$ because the producer-consumer pattern (which is 1-synchronizable) does not increase the needed bound for reaching the exchange serializability bad pattern. Therefore, our method always terminate (in practice) and establishes synchronizabiity, or will find the serializability bad pattern, although we do not have any non-artificial example where the latter case occurs. 

% To summarize, the contributions of this paper are the following:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item A new bounded analysis for message passing programs called Exchange Bounded Analysis. This analysis is based on exploring $k$-synchronous computations. The complexity of state reachability under EBA is PSPACE-complete. 
%
%\item A procedure for deciding $k$-synchronizability of asynchronous message passing programs. The procedure never considers the asynchronous semantics, and it is based on a exchange bounded analysis of an instrumented version of the original program. Consequently, the state reachability problem is decidable for $k$-synchronizable programs. Deciding  $k$-synchronizability and state reachability in this case is PSPACE-complete. 
%
%\item A procedure for deciding synchronizability for a class of message passing programs called flow-bounded programs. The procedure  uses an iteration of exchange bounded analyses of instrumented versions of the program. Consequently, the state reachability problem is decidable for synchronizable flow-bounded programs. 
%%Deciding  synchronizability and state reachability in this case is PSPACE-complete. 
%
%\item The results above are also applicable to verifying the existence of deadlocks. 
%
%\item Our approach is applicable to many practically relevant examples of programs. In all examples we found, our approach is able to terminate and prove synchronizability.
